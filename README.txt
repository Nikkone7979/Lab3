First program: Bubblesort in C#
This is my attempt to write imperatively in C# by making a bubblesort that is hard coded into the main function.
C# is a multi paradigm language that felt very similar to Java.

Second program: Selectionsort in Ruby
This is my attempt to write imperatively in Ruby by making a selectionsort function to be called later in the program.
Ruby is a "general purpose" language that felt extremely easy to work with.
