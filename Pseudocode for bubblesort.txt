Bubblesort in C#:

Instantiate an arbitrary array,
Call a variable j  to hold a number in the algorithm
	For p going from 0 to the last number of the array:
		For i going from 0 to the last number of the array:
		if the ith spot of the array is greater than the next slot of the array:
			hold the next slot of the array as j
			swap the two slots
			set the ith slot to the number j was holding

This is a basic bubblesort in C#
