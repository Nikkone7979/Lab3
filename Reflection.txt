	The languages I chose for this lab assignment were Ruby and C#. I initially wanted to select Pascal and Fortran, but those languages felt obsolete when I looked at them. It was difficult to select a strictly imperative language because a lot of them felt outdated. It felt like it wasn't worth my time to download an IDE to work with them when I can write imperatively with most object oriented languages. I also wanted to write in C, but C is so similar in syntax to C++ that I went with C# instead.
	I've already known a little bit of C# going into this, but I only knew how to use it strictly as an object oriented language working with objects in unity - I've never written anything imperatively with it. C# in this case felt very similar to Java in that everything had to be within the scope of a class. Ruby was my second choice, and I've never worked with it at all; this one was much more challenging for me. Ruby felt like a step up from C languages to me in terms of syntax - it felt more clearer after I learned some of the syntax. The syntax looks cleaner to me and the tools are more convenient. 
	I was surprised with how little code I ended up with after implementing my selection sort on Ruby. The amount of code needed with a C language or Java is usually a little more than what I wrote with Ruby. The algorithm required me to think about it a little differently since the control structures can be defined in a more "straightforward" manner. Instead of iterating the loop using 3 conditions, you can iterate the loop directly by calling the ".times" function, and have it "do" whatever the body of code would otherwise be. Overall, Ruby is a language that definitely seemed interesting to me.
