Pseudocode for selection sort in ruby:

Define a function that takes an array,
	//Ruby supports the ability to implement a for loop directly for a defined amount of times
	Instantiate a variable immediately to be the length of the array: x
	Call the variable using the function .times to iterate the loop x amount of times
		Set a variable i = to the minimum
		For j in i + 1 going to the size of the array
			Compare array[j] and array[current minimum] and set the new minimum
		Check if array [i] and array[minimum] are the same, swap them if they are not
	End loop
