Ruby is a lot different from the C based languages I've written in:
'end' is used instead of ;
Methods/functions are defined by simply "def" followed by the function name, and then the parameters.
Variables don't need data types assigned to them, and can be called and treated like objects.
For loops are have a drastically different syntax, ".." is used for traversing an array (from i + 1 to x in this case)
"puts" is a function that prints text to the console
Ruby seems to have overall less restrictions on syntax than other languages I've worked with.
