I wanted to pick a C language because I felt it would be easy to carry over the syntax that I already knew

The first main difference I found was everything being within the scope of the namespace.

"Namespaces are heavily used in C# programming in two ways. First, .NET uses namespaces to organize its many classes"

The second difference was after being within the scope of the namepsace, all of the code was then within the scope
of the class. Your main function would go within the scope of both of these.

The rest of the syntax is mostly similar to other C based languages. Printing to the console had a different
object call: Console.WriteLine.
